Abbreviation,Code,Description
TDM,TDM,"Themis improves technical debt management (if a specific TDM activity is specified, use that code instead (TD-*))"
TD-REPAY-OPP,OPPORTUNISTIC TD REPAYMENT,Developers repay debt localized in the same file that they are currently editing without it being the initial purpose of the edition on that file. They do it because it has an impact on their score.
TD-ID,TD IDENTIFICATION,"Themis helps detecting intentional or unintentional TD via, e.g., static code analysis"
TD-MEAS,TD MEASUREMENT,Themis helps quantifying estimating the level of the overall TD
TD-PRIO,TD PRIORITIZATION,Themis allows to rank identified TD according to certain predefined rules
TD-PREV,TD PREVENTION,Themis aims to prevent potential TD from being incurred
TD-REPAY,TD REPAYMENT,Themis helps developers to resolve existing TD in a software system
TD-COMM,TD COMMUNICATION,Themis makes identified TD visible to stakeholders so that it can be discussed and further managed
TD-EVOL,TD EVOLUTION MONITORING,Themis provides a way to monitor the actions affecting the evolution of technical debt
,,
TDR-POS,POSITIVE IMPACT ON TD REDUCTION,The tool has a positive impact on TD reduction (accelerates TD reduction)
TDR-NO,NO IMPACT ON TD REDUCTION,The tool does not have an impact on TD reduction
TDR-NEG,NEGATIVE IMPACT ON TD REDUCTION,The tool has a negative impact on TD reduction (slows down TD reduction)
,,
QUAL-STD,QUALITY STANDARDS,Participants are more attentive to quality standards and processes because of Themis
WORK,"STAFFING, WORKLOAD, WORK DISTRIBUTION",Themis allows participants to evaluate and act on their workload and work distribution
LIMT,LIMITATIONS,Mentions of existing/possible limitations of the approach
LMT-FITALL,LIMITATION: “ONE SIZE FITS ALL”,The tool might not have the same impact with all participants and/or in other teams
LMT-DISC,LIMITATION: DISCOURAGEMENT,Some aspects of the tool or some situations may be discouraging for developers
LMT-CONFLICT,LIMITATION: CONFLICTS,The gamified aspects of the tool can cause or exacerbate existing conflicts
LMT-NO-MOT,NO CHANGE IN MOTIVATION,Participants did not see a change in motivation to manage TD
,,
CTX,CONTEXT,The tool can be configured to fit the context of the project (e.g. legacy code)
CTX-INTTD,INTENTIONAL TD,Some TD is intentionally left in the source code
CTX-INTEG,INTEGRATION IN DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES,The tool is integrated well into the team’s development process
CONF-TEAM,CONFIGURATION MADE BY THE TEAM,Configuration of the rules is discussed by the whole team
CONF-SEV,CONFIGURATION BASED ON SEVERITY OF VIOLATIONS,Configuration of the rules is based on severity of TD
,,
CRIT,CRITICISM,General negative feedback and criticism
,,
VIS,VISUAL FEEDBACK,The effect of the tool is dependent on visual feedback/how data is displayed
SYNTH,SYNTHESIS,Themis provides synthesis/aggregate information to participant
,,
MOT-INC,INCREASE IN MOTIVATION/INVOLVEMENT,Motivation and involvement of stakeholders in TDM was increased
MOT-INT,INTRINSIC MOTIVATION,Participants are motivated by their own self-improvement
MOT-EXT,EXTRINSIC MOTIVATION,Participants are motivated by rewards
MOT-EMUL,EMULATION/COMPETITION DYNAMIC,Participants are trying to be as good as others
MOT-LEAD,MAKING PROGRESS IN THE LEADERBOARD,Participants want to progress up the leaderboard
MOT-COMP,COMPARISON WITH PEERS,Participants are comparing their performance to their colleagues
