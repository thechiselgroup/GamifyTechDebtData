1,"Several goals (unordered)
- bring innovation/novelty in the team
- have a tooled approach the code quality management
- Information is factual (what is done, who does it, how “healthy” is the team)
- Ability to drive and monitor
- put code quality at the center of the team’s concerns
",2,"All the information appear relevant and useful to me
I am looking in priority at the main action report which provides the best synthesis
Goals are not used a lot yet, but I think that if they were that would be the second thing I would look at.
From my position (I completely delegate the monitoring and management of the team), I am more looking for aggregate information allowing me to do medium/long term monitoring.",Discussing with the people I delegate the monitoring and management of the team to.,0,6,"If the ‘rules’ of code quality are standardized, it is important for the team to have a critical look at their application.
Working on a project for more than 10 years, we are inheriting a consequent history: we need to be able to set quality goals in the different parts of source code.",Collective discussion. Result of a study on calibration made by Promyze,NA,This decision belongs to the team,"All the information seem relevant to me. I mainly use the one that give me an aggregate vision of a team’s activity (involved entities, events distribution)",Aggregate vision of the team’s activity,Not for the time being,No,"No at the time, but this is one of the goals (ability to detect needs of sharing and/or training on a topic)",Both,"Not enough hindsight for now. Ultimately, I think that the amount of point should be more relevant",6,Ability to direct the debt correction towards the debt that has a high risk rating.,No: this activity is left to the team and direct managers,NA,NA,"It is an experimentation, the usage is free.",Very good!,"Yes: If it is taken in a playful way, the leaderboard is a very good emulation tool, but there is however a risk that it is taken badly.","Version 0.1 disappointed because it was below what was perceived during the presentation and because of the integration with clearcase which brought bugs.
Version 0.2 was very well received.","Yes a positive impact, but it remains difficult to quantify for the time being",NA,With the action plans from Sonar,No,"Too long to describe!
Overall, set up screens showing a summary of the “health” of a team. Long terms indicators showing the impact of action plans.",yes,Yes,Yes
2,Improve how technical debt is managed inside my development team,1,"The news feed, because it allows me to see in real time who from my team is currently developing . The leaderboard, to have a quick glance of the current team dynamic on the sprint.","Mainly, discussion with the team or with a particular person. The goal is to share the elements passed on by Themis and eventually draw actions from them.",Only once after the tool was tested and after discussing it with the team,7,"Anomalies created and fixed by developers are strongly connected to the project’s context (age, architectural choices, …)
It is then important to leave the possibility to configure points so that their distribution can be fair and takes the project context into account","I attach a lot on importance to the flow of new code. It need to bring a very low or null debt. On the remainder of the legacy code, which is more or less old (1-10 years), we are setting adapted requirement levels.",To have an allocation of points that is more connected to the reality of the project.,With the whole team. The amount of points added/removed is proportional to how critical the anomaly is.,Mainly the comparison by category and the actions history.,Not in a very structured way for now. It is discussed with the team and can eventually guide us in the process modification,"No, not for the time being. I doubt this will be the case on a short term. Debt management is pulled by the team itself and It does not require actions from me at the moment.","It happened to me sometimes to see if the object on which he intervenes is source of issues regarding technical debt, or to see if a new resource is in phase with our development methods.","None, the technical debt management process is not a matter of managerial decisions",Mainly the number of points,Because it takes into account the project’s context and weighs the positive/negative actions according to how important we see them.,7,Clearly contributes to the involvement of the team and allows to keep a continuous improvement dynamic by focusing on themes adapted to the current context.,No ‘unused import’ on the sprint by the team and on the whole project. Two goals: test the setup of a process and sensitize the team about not committing code with these anomalies. Do right on the first time.,It depends of the chosen subject. In our situation we wanted the developer to commit correct code on the first try. For that the idea is to reward the lack of negative actions.,We attribute it to the team because it is the team that bears the debt management dynamic. We do not want to target a specific developer at the moment.,Autonomous learning of the tool. No particular directives,In a positive way. It created a good competition dynamic in the team. But I remain cautious that this competitive aspect is not harmful to some individuals in the team.,Yes. Some developer have a more discreet nature and gamification may not be a good motivator for these ones.,"Globally positive comments. Allows to have hindsight on the defects created by developers while integrating a game aspect that really stimulates a big part of the team. Others are less convinced and do not see any particular interest, because Sonar is enough for them.","We had started to set up indicators on our visual management screens using the Sonar API. A good team dynamic regarding the debt was born at that time. Themis arrived slightly after and continued this effort with a lot more features. We observed a clear decrease during the first two weeks after the installation of Themis. It is less clear now, The debt continues to decrease now the same way than before the introduction of Themis.",No specific challenge,Visual management on a numerical screen with sonar action plans and tools using the sonar API,"No, I don’t think so","Since its setup a few months ago, Themis already evolved a lot, with aspects that we wished to see. The current version seems very interesting to me. The work area to follow is, I think, gamification with an access to the points history, and trophies.",yes,Yes,Yes
3,Master debt and from now on the debt reduction,2,"The color code and the leaderboard allows to have a daily summary of the action impacting the debt, but it is the action reports at the end of the sprint that are useful to me in order to create action plans, or to provide reminders to the team or individuals, if needed.","If I detect ‘critical’ negative actions, I may ask the affected person even before the end of the sprint.",0-1,7,"To customize Themis to our history and our way of working, and that is indispensable.","We are managing technical debt since more than a year, we started by setting up simple actions to control the debt (no increase of the number of violations), and Themis provides a tooling to reflect on that and begin collective actions on the debt. For now, we are mainly relying on the severity of violations.","The points and leaderboard system (gamification) was favorably adopted by the team. However, the team rapidly required to modify the weight of actions for a fairer ranking, which we agreed to.",Team choice,"The report grouped by rule, by team, and eventually by individual in the actions history",It lead to some reminders and to the creation of action plans,It lead to some reminders and to the creation of action plans,"Because the experience relative to the project, the development experience, and the level of involvement on the debt is completely different depending on the person. Often, I need to know the persons responsible of specific action to discuss with them.","At the time, it is mostly about reminding good practices, which was done individually when it was the case.",Mainly the number of actions,"Actions weights were modified in agreement with the team and I find this rather fair. However, debt is about all the actions and good practices apply to all the rules.",6,It helps monitoring and measurement of goals completion.,"The first action plan was created to introduce action plans: reward the non-violation of a specific rule
The second plan was created to reduce the debt by rewarding 10 positive actions on the rules from the ‘maintenance’ category, but it did not work very well because of the lack of availability of the team at that point.","Goals are often suggested by managers and then shared in team meetings, and the points attributed also come from this discussion.","At the time, we only created team action plans","No particular instruction, but rapidly the developers providing violations found an interest in it.",Positively,"Probably yes in other project, but in our case the choice was unanimous and we did not observe any derive since its installation","Yes. Negative comments come from the most experienced developers, who are the most sensitive to the non-creation of debt. They think that Themis does not bring anything to them.",Very rich tooling to manage debt continuously,The instability of Themis during the first three sprint made some people weary,Sonar only,No,NA,yes,Yes,Yes
